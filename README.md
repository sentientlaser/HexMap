# HexMap Generator

This is a simple hexagonal grid system for Unity.  Includes some basic math functions and a simple generator integration for the Unity Editor.

It represents about 2 weeks of part time investment in re-learning C# and transitioning from V3 to V7.3, as well as learning Unity which was entirely new to me.  It's worth noting that Unity is a _very_ different thing to .NET per-se, so there's some difference in the idiomatics of the code.

Some files are cleanly documented, some were experimental and did not get dressed with doc comments.
